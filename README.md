1. The dataset adult_train.txt and adult_test.txt includes 48842 samples and 14 features.

2. Utilized five different train models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network.

3. Evaluate the performance of each mode using F1 scores and draw Normalized Confusion Matrix.
